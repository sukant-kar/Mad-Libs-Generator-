# Mad-Libs-Generator-
This python beginner project is a good start for beginner software developers as it has concepts like strings, variables, and concatenation. Mad Libs Generator teaches to manipulate user-inputted data as the Mad Libs refer to a series of inputs that a user enters. The input from the user could be anything from an adjective, a pronoun, or even a verb. After all the inputs are entered the application takes all the data and arranges it to build a story template.
